# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to take data from a rideshare company like Lyft or Uber (in this case Pyber), and perform key analysis on important data for each city such as average fare, percentage of drivers, percentage of fares, etc.
## Results: 
![Fig1](Resources/Fig1.png)
![Fig2](Resources/Fig2.png)
From Figure 1 and 2 we can see that each city type is typically in its own bracket, excluding a few outliers. For rural PyBer rides, rides tend to be more expensive but have less total rides while for Urban rides, rides tend to be a little cheaper and more abundant. Suburban rides are in the middle spectrum.

From the DataFrame Summary we can see that that the disparity between City Types is quite apparent, they do not overlap and are in their own brackets.

From the pie charts above, it can be seen that PyBer rides are dominated by Urban users. 
## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on these results some suggestions that I would make to the CEO and the marketing team for PyBer would be:
* Offer more promotions for drivers to go out to rural/subburban areas, this would promote more drivers to not be so picky about rides going away from the city
* Offer more deals for Pyber users who are located in Rural/Suburban areas, sometimes that big price tag may intimidate users and make them find others ways to commute to the city.
* Offer a membership for users further away from the city, like a mileagle system for planes. The more miles you accumulate the more credits you can recieve.
